I am a Principal Technical Strategist at [VAST Data][] where I maintain
an understanding of where HPC/AI technologies are headed to help people, both
inside and outside of VAST, make decisions about the future. In practice, my
job involves a mix of talking to practitioners to understand their workloads,
analyzing new technologies to understand their capabilities, and sharing what
I've learned in whatever ways make sense to people facing uncertainy and tough
challenges.

Before joining VAST, I was a Principal Engineer at Microsoft where I supported
the design and operations of the [largest AI supercomputers being built in
Azure][azurehpc]. Prior to that, I was a systems architect at the [National
Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] where I focused on
storage and data research and designed a couple of large, high-performance
storage systems.

More information about my current and past work can be found on [Google Scholar][] and in my [biography][].

This site contains my notes in technical computing from over the years. Older
notes and blog posts are linked below, but I have started moving my personal
notes to my <b><a href="/garden/">digital garden</a></b> which I update continuously.
