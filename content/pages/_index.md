I am a technologist working in supercomputing and infrastructure for HPC and AI.
I combine direct operational experience with systems-level analysis to inform
architecture, strategy, and industry understanding.

I used to work at Microsoft where I supported the [largest AI supercomputers
being built in Azure][azurehpc]. Prior to that, I was a systems architect at
the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] where
I focused on storage and data. More information about my current and past work
can be found on [Google Scholar][] and in my [biography][].

This site contains my notes in technical computing from over the years. Older
notes and blog posts are linked below, but I have started moving my personal
notes to my <b><a href="/garden/">digital garden</a></b> which I update continuously.
